An agent-based model (ABM) [or IBM - individual-based models as often called in
ecology] is one of a class of computational models for simulating the actions
and interactions of autonomous agents.
Monte-Carlo methods are used to introduce the randomness
(Chap.\ref{sec:monte-carlo-simul}).


ABM is similar, but not the same as MAS (multi-agent system) - Chap.\ref{chap:MultiAgentSystem}.

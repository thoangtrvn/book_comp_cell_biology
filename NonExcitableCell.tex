Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cell line) are non-excitable cells with 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item simple morphology
  \item constant genetic background
\end{enumerate}
Many studies assume CHO-native cells lack voltage-dependent
membrane conductances. Yet
\begin{itemize}
  \item  chloride and sodium conductances were reported to be present
  in CHO-native cells
  
  \item voltage-dependent Ca2+ conductance of CHO-K1 cells (Skryma et al 1994)
  
 similar to the high-threshold L-type of Ca2+ current previously observed in
 excitable cells:  can be carried by Ca2+ or Ba2+ ions, blocked by both
 inorganic (Co2+) and organic (nifedipine, isradipine) Ca2+ channel blockers.
 
 The unitary conductance: 19 pS in 60 mM Ca2+, by single exponential
 distribution of open times (t = 0.84 ms) and biexponential distribution of
 closed times (tr = 1.67 ms, t, = 7.9 ms )

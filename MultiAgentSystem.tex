\chapter{Multi-Agent System}
\label{chap:MultiAgentSystem}

Compared to Agent-based model (ABM - Chap.\ref{chap:Agent-based_Model}, MAS is
typically used in more difficult problem, where intelligence need to be
included, e.g.
online trading, disaster response, modelling social structures. The main feature
which is achieved when developing multi-agent systems, is flexibility, since a
multi-agent system can be added to, modified and reconstructed, without the need
for detailed rewriting of the application. The systems also tend to prevent
propagation of faults, self-recover and be fault tolerant, mainly due to the
redundancy of components.

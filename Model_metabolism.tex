~\citep{achs1977,achs1977b} were the first to model metabolic dynamics
of substrate utilization and energy transfer in cardiac myocytes. This
encompassed about 90 biochemical reactions, described by either mass
action laws of Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  Different pathways:
glycolysis, $\beta$-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation, were
included; as well as compartmentalization, transport of intermediatory
interactions (e.g. effect of ATP, ADP on the activity of glycolytic
enzymes).
